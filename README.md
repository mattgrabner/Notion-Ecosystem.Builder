# Company Ecosystem Landscape Updater

## Overview

This suite of scripts is designed to automate the process of creating a landscape of company ecosystems. It updates a Notion database with detailed company descriptions, extracted from a collection of URLs, and generates concise summaries using OpenAI's GPT model. The system works by scraping web content, summarizing it, and then populating a Notion database with the relevant information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Notion account and integration token
- OpenAI account and API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
4. Fill in the `.env` file with your Notion API key and OpenAI API key:

    ```
    NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

## Notion Database Setup

Your Notion database should have the following columns for the scripts to function properly:

- `URL`: containing URLs to scrape content from
- `Description`: where the scraped content will be stored
- `Summary`: where a short summary generated by GPT-4 will be stored
- `Company / Organization`: the name of the company
- `Category`: the category of the company
- `Active`: indicating whether the company is active or not

## Usage

To run the update process, execute the `run.py` script as follows:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

You will be prompted to input your Notion Database ID. The script will then proceed to:

- Scrape content from the URLs specified in the `URL` column of your Notion database.
- Update the `Description` column with the scraped content.
- Generate short summaries using OpenAI's GPT and update the `Summary` column.

Please note that the `Summary` column will be updated only if it's empty and the company is marked as 'Active'.

## Important Notes

- Make sure your Notion API token has access to the database you want to update.
- Always keep your API keys secure and do not share your `.env` file.
