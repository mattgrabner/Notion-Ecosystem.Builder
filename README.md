# 🌐 Company Ecosystem Landscape Updater

## Overview 📜

🚀 This suite of scripts is designed to automate the process of creating a landscape of company ecosystems. It updates a Notion database with detailed company descriptions, extracted from a collection of URLs, and generates concise summaries using OpenAI's GPT model. The system works by scraping web content, summarizing it, and then populating a Notion database with the relevant information.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Notion account and integration token
- OpenAI account and API key

## Installation 🔧

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
4. Fill in the `.env` file with your Notion API key and OpenAI API key:

    ```
    NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

## Notion Database Setup 🗃️

Ensure your Notion database has these columns:

- `URL`: containing URLs to scrape content from
- `Description`: where the scraped content will be stored
- `Summary`: where a short summary generated by GPT-4 will be stored
- `Company / Organization`: the name of the company
- `Category`: the category of the company
- `Active`: indicating whether the company is active or not

## Usage 🛠️

To run the update process, execute the `run.py` script:

    ```
    python run.py
    ```

You'll be prompted to input your Notion Database ID, after which:

- Scrape content from the URLs in the `URL` column.
- Update the `Description` with the scraped content.
- Generate summaries using OpenAI's GPT for the `Summary` column.

## Important Notes 📝

- Ensure Notion API token access.
- Keep your API keys secure.
